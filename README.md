## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```<source media="(max-width: )" srcset=""> - Using this html element can be really useful, when an image gets to a smaller size, it gives another image without having to use a media query.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  max-width: 1000px; - I always love using this css property because of how handy it can be when making the layout to a certain size, and stays that way even when larging the webpage even more.
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

For my next projects I'm planning to use a css framework and to see how handy it can be like "css tailwind" or "bootstrap".

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) - This is one of the website's that helped me get better at coding and helps me to refresh my memory whenever I forget on how to use a certain css property.
